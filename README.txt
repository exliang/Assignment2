Project Description: This project uses the Python programming language, multiple methods, loops, lists, branching, the Profile module, and built-in methods to create a program for users to create a journal system that can inspect, create, delete, open, edit, and print data in their file system. 

What my software does: This program utilizes the pathlib module to get user input using the following main commands: L, Q, C, D, R, O, E, P, and admin. Q terminates the program, while L prints out the contents of a specific directory (inputted from the user) and has sub-commands: -r, -f, -s, -e. -r prints out the directory and its subdirectory's content using recursion. -f only prints out the files that are in the specified directory. -s prints out all files that match the name of a specified file (inputted from the user). The specific file name must be specified after the -s on the command line. -e prints out all files that match the specific file extension (inputted from the user). The specific file extension must be specified after the -e on the command line. This program also allows the user to type two sub-commands only if the first sub-command is -r, meaning that the possible commands are -r -f, -r -s, and -r -e. After typing L, the user must type a path before typing the sub-commands. C creates a new dsu file in the user-inputed directory. The user needs to type -n filename after the path. D deletes a DSU file, and R reads and outputs the DSU file's contents line by line. O opens the journal to prepare for writing to the journal. E edits the journal and has subcommands: -usr, -pwd, -bio, -addpost, -delpost. -usr edits the username of the journal using the command 'E -usr username'. -pwd edits the password of the journal using the command 'E -pwd password'. -bio edits the bio of the journal using the command 'E -bio biography'. -addpost adds a post to the journal using the command 'E -adddpost newpost'. -delpost deletes a post from the journal using the command 'E -delpost postnumber' where the postnumber starts at 0. Command E also allows for any of the combinations above combined and must be called after calling command C or O. P outputs the data stored in journal and has subcommands as well. -usr outputs the username stored in the journal using the command 'P -usr'. -pwd outputs the password stored in the journal using the command 'P -pwd'. -bio outputs the bio stored in the journal using the command 'P -bio'. -posts outputs all the posts stored in the journal using the command 'P -posts'. -post outputs a post by its postnumber using the command 'P -post postnumber' where postnumber starts at 0. -all outputs all the content in the journal using the command 'P -all'. Command P also allows for any of the combinations above combined and must be called after calling command C or O. Finally, admin is a mode where the friendly user interface is disabled.

How to run this software: Type py a2.py or python a2.py in the Command Line/Windows Powershell/Terminal/Git Bash.
